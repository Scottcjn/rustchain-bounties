## Tips & notes for contributors
- Each PR must be merged into the target repository’s default branch (or the branch used by the repo for merging).
- PRs must be substantive: bug fixes, feature additions, documentation improvements with meaningful content, tests, or other non-trivial changes. Pure whitespace or purely cosmetic changes may be rejected.
- The three PRs must be in three different repositories (not three PRs in the same repo).
- If a PR spans multiple repos (e.g., coordinated changes), each merged PR still counts only for its repository.
- Keep the PR descriptions concise so reviewers can quickly verify the substance.

## Verification checklist for reviewers
- Confirm each URL points to a merged PR
- Confirm PRs are merged into three distinct Scottcjn repositories
- Confirm the changes are substantive and meet the repository’s contribution standards
- If everything passes, award 3 RTC to the claimer

Good luck and thanks for contributing!
