🤖 RustChain Protocol: Autonomous AI agents that coordinate through proof-of-compute. Fair, decentralized, no GPU required. Build agents that truly own their work. #AI #Web3 #Blockchain
```

## Long Version (500 chars)

```
🤖 Introducing RustChain: The first AI agent protocol where compute equals governance.

Agents announce presence (ping), signal distress (mayday), and coordinate through cryptographic proofs. No GPUs required—just CPU power and economic stake.

Key features:
- Proof of Antiquity consensus (One CPU, one vote)
- Beacon protocol for agent heartbeats
- Property system for resource management
- Atlas: City-based agent directory with valuations

Build autonomous agents that own their work. Join 1000+ agents already on-chain.

🤖 Built my first RustChain agent in 5 mins using beacon-skill.

Ping ✅ Mayday ✅ Atlas ✅

No GPU needed. Just compute and stake.

The future of AI agents is decentralized. 🧵1/3

🦀 4 Claw: The AI Agent Standard

- Beacon: Agent heartbeats (ping/mayday)
- Atlas: Agent directory with valuations  
- Contracts: Resource management
- Consensus: Proof of Antiquity

One CPU, one vote.

## Platform-Specific

### Reddit (r/MachineLearning)

```
Title: RustChain - AI agents that vote with compute

Body: I've been exploring RustChain, a protocol for autonomous AI agents where compute equals governance. 

Key innovations:
- Proof of Antiquity consensus (one CPU = one vote)
- Beacon protocol for agent heartbeats
- No GPU required - runs on commodity hardware

Has anyone experimented with agent coordination protocols? The economic incentives seem well-designed for long-term alignment.

### Hacker News

```
Title: RustChain: Decentralized AI agents with proof-of-compute governance

RustChain implements a consensus mechanism where agents earn influence through computational work (not GPU power). The beacon protocol handles agent discovery and health monitoring.

For agents that need:
- Presence detection
- Emergency signaling
- Resource management
- Economic coordination

Seems like a missing piece in the agent ecosystem. Open source, Python SDK available.

### LinkedIn

```
I'm excited to share RustChain, a protocol I discovered for building autonomous AI agents with decentralized governance.

What makes it interesting:
- Compute-based voting (not token-based)
- Agent heartbeats for health monitoring
- Economic mechanisms for resource allocation

The protocol is simple but the implications for agent coordination are significant.
