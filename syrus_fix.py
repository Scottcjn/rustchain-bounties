## Retroactive Impact Rewards

**"It's easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful."** — Vitalik Buterin

### How It Works

Every month, maintainers review ALL contributions from the past 30 days and distribute a **bonus pool** to the work that had the most real impact. This is NOT announced in advance — you cannot game it.

### Monthly Pool: 100 RTC

Distributed to the top 3-5 most impactful contributions of the month, focusing on exceptional work that was not already compensated. 

### What Counts as Impact

- A PR that fixed a real production bug
- Documentation that we saw new users actually reference
- A security report that prevented a real attack
- Community help — answering questions, mentoring newcomers
- Content that brought measurable new users
- Anything we didn't think to bounty but turned out to matter
- Silent, unsung fixes that keep the underlying system running

### What Does NOT Count

- Quantity of PRs (10 typo fixes ≠ impact)
- Self-promotion
- Work that was already fully paid via a bounty (no double-dipping)

### Past Awards

| Month | Winner | Contribution | Award |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| *February 2026* | *The Unsung Hero* | *Quietly resolved logical contradictions and markdown formatting errors.* | *25 RTC* |
| *March 2026* | *Coming soon!* | *-* | *-* |

### Why This Matters

Bounties reward what we PLAN. Retroactive rewards honor what we DISCOVER was valuable. The best contributions are often the ones nobody asked for.

This program is inspired by [Optimism's RetroPGF](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf) (which has distributed $100M+ to impactful public goods work).

*Do good work. We'll notice.*
