## Retroactive Impact Rewards

> *"It's easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful."* — Vitalik Buterin

### Architecture & Mechanism

Every month, the community and maintainers nominate contributions from the past 30 days. A **bonus pool** is then distributed to the work that demonstrated the highest realized value. Because specific deliverables are not predefined, the system resists gaming—you only win by delivering actual, measurable impact.

### Monthly Pool Allocation: 100 RTC

Distributed dynamically to the top 3-5 most impactful contributions of the month. Allocation is proportional to the observed value generated for the ecosystem.

### What Qualifies as Value

- **Critical Fixes:** A PR that resolved a live production vulnerability or bottleneck.
- **High-Utility Resources:** Documentation or tooling that metrics show users actively rely on.
- **Ecosystem Defense:** Security reports or structural improvements that prevented realized risk.
- **Force Multiplication:** Answering complex questions, mentoring newcomers, or unblocking other contributors.
- **Unprompted Innovation:** High-leverage work we didn't think to bounty, but fundamentally improved the project.

### What Does NOT Qualify

- **Vanity Metrics:** High volume of low-effort PRs (e.g., 10 trivial typo fixes ≠ impact).
- **Self-Promotion:** Content optimized for personal reach rather than ecosystem growth.
- **Fairly Compensated Work:** Bountied tasks where the initial payout adequately matched the generated value. *(Note: Bountied work that delivered outsized, unexpected value beyond its original scope remains eligible for an impact top-up).*

### Impact Ledger

| Month | Contributor | High-Value Contribution | Allocation |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------|------------|
| *March 2026* | *TBD* | *Continuous value monitoring in progress...* | |

### The Value-First Philosophy

Standard bounties incentivize what we *predict* will be useful. Retroactive rewards validate what we *discover* is valuable. By deferring the reward until the impact is proven, we align contributor incentives directly with the long-term success of the protocol.

*Inspired by [Optimism's RetroPGF](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf).*

**Build value. The architecture will recognize it.**
