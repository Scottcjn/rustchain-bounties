## Bounty: [Achievement] Documenter - Improve Docs in 3+ Repos - 3 RTC

**Approach:**  
To earn the Documenter achievement, I will identify three repositories under the Scottcjn organization that lack sufficient documentation or have outdated documentation. For each repository, I will analyze the existing documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING.md, docstrings, comments, examples, etc.) and propose meaningful improvements. I will then create and submit PRs for each repository with the following focus areas:

1. **Repository 1**: Improve `README.md` with clear project description, setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.  
2. **Repository 2**: Add or improve `CONTRIBUTING.md` with detailed contribution instructions, code of conduct, and PR template.  
3. **Repository 3**: Enhance code comments, docstrings, and add examples or tutorials to improve code understanding.

After submitting the PRs, I will ensure they are merged and post the links as a comment in the bounty issue to claim the reward.
